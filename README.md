# TCP Message Broker – University Project

This repository contains a **university group project** where we designed and implemented a simple **TCP-based Message Broker** system.  

The system is composed of three main components:
- **Publisher** – sends messages to the broker.
- **Subscriber** – listens for and receives messages from the broker.
- **Message Broker** – acts as the central server that routes messages from publishers to subscribers.

## Project Goals
- Understand the fundamentals of **socket programming** over TCP.
- Implement a **message broker architecture** from scratch.
- Gain experience with **distributed systems concepts** (publish/subscribe pattern).
- Collaborate in a **group setting** using proper version control and project structure.
